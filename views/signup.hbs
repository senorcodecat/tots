        <h1>Complete Registration for Tots</h1>

        <p>
            I am glad you want to join Tots!
            I hope it is a fun place for you to post stuff and
            chat with people.
            I remember when social networks were fun, I hope you do too!
        </p>

        <p>
            With an account, you can post stuff,
            follow people, fave posts, and receive
            notifications. You can also use the Tot bot,
            an SMS interface for posting. Cool, I know.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before you get started, we need to set up your account.
        </p>

            <label>Username:</label>
            <span class="tip">This will be part of your profile URL, and people can @mention you with it.</span>
            <input ng-model="ui.user_profile.username" required pattern="\w+">
        </p>

        <p>
            <label>Display Name:</label>
            <span class="tip">This will be displayed on your posts and profile.</span>
            <input ng-model="ui.user_profile.displayName" required >
        </p>
